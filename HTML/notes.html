  <h2>Javascript Notes</h2>
  <p>Date: 2025-05-30</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can make console for website display messages with inspect => console => use alert syntax => eg: alert('hello'); syntax</li>
    <li>document.body.innerHTML => getting content from HTML </li>
    <li>Take away is that you have access to a console if JS is present in the page</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Lesson 2 (JS)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You can also use the console to input operators such as */+- and %, etc... </li>
    <li>Can also handle floats in console</li>
    <li> / ^ * have same priority, as with + ^ -, () are avaialable as well.</li>
    <li>JS has weird properties where operators with floats give innacurate outputs, this is due to the binary conversion giving the computer weird properties, in other words floats are stored weird.</li>
    <li>To avoid this calculate cents instead of dollars (whole ints, just avoid floats)</li>
    <li>1. Convert dollars to cents as a whole int. 
        2. then convert back to dollars after summation</li>
    <li>To round numbers => Math.round(float)</li>
  </ul>
